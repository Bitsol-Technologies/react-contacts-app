# Contacts Demo App using Vite
**Note: this project is a port of awesome tutorial of [react-router-v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) using [Redux Toolkit Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)**

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite + React App](https://vitejs.dev/guide).

## Available Scripts

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm preview`

See the section about [running preview](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#command-line-interface) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
